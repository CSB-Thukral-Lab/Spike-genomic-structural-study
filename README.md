# Spike_genomic-structural_study

This folder contains data files from the genomic analysis and MD simulation trajectories from the manuscript: Coaxial framework of spike protein mutational ensemble in SARS-CoV-2 genomes By Saman Fatihi, Surabhi Rathore, Ankit Pathak,Deepanshi Gahlot, Mitali Mukerji, Nidhi Jatana,Lipi Thukral

The files for genomic analysis are organised below
A. Genomic Analysis data 
A1. Prevalence data for spike variants needleplot
A2. Mutational genomic ensemble heatmap data
A3. Cluster wise evolution data

B. Structural models of wild-type and eight mutant clusters

C. MD simulation data 
C1. Intermittent six structures derived at different time points of the simulation trajectories for wild and D614G mutant
